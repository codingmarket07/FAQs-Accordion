							<p>Will the mission be harmful to Mars environment? </p>
						</div>
						<div class="li_ans">
							Mars One will take specific steps to ensure that the Mars environment (which we will study, and on which we will depend) will not be harmed. The Mars base will be forced to recycle just about everything, and pay close attention to its energy use and minimize the leakage of materials and energy. Nutrients are scarce on Mars. They either need to be imported from Earth, or extracted from the ground or atmosphere. Solar panels, which will also be launched from Earth, will generate the settlement's electricity. All of this means that a Mars resident will have a much smaller ecological footprint than that of the average person on Earth.

							<p>Is this a sustainable mission?</p>
						</div>
						<div class="li_ans">
							A sustainable base on Mars is capable of generating its own power, sustenance and provisions. Solar panels can generate all of the settlement's energy with only sunlight as fuel. The base will also recycle as much as they can to avoid more resources having to be sent from Earth or having to delve for more in the local air and soil. When it comes to provisions, their independence will increase steadily, starting with their own production of oxygen and water when they land. The first four will also be carrying a device similar to a portable greenhouse, that will allow them to grow their own food.

							<p>What are the risks of dust and sand on Mars? </p>
						</div>
						<div class="li_ans">
							All equipment that will be sent to Mars must be built specifically to withstand the conditions there. The environment of Mars contains dust that is much finer than that found on Earth. While the exact effects of this fine dust on technical hardware and equipment are not fully known, it is not impossible to engineer equipment that can handle the dust. The NASA rovers Spirit and Opportunity were designed to operate for a minimum of 90 days, but have exceeded their target lifespans substantially. Spirit lasted about 1900 days. Opportunity is still driving around and investigating Mars since January 2004.

							<p>Why should we go to Mars?</p>
						</div>
						<div class="li_ans">
							The first is the realization of an amazing dream! Sending a manned mission to Mars is a fantastic adventure. Imagine living on another planet, millions of miles from the Earth; looking up into the sky with the knowledge that one of the 'stars' is actually the planet you were born on. Who can even envision the incredible feeling of being the first human in history to step out of the capsule and leave your footprint on the surface of Mars? By this we implore you to not just think of that feeling for the astronaut, but the experience for all those watching back home. Those who observed Neil Armstrong land on the Moon all those years ago still remember every detail â€“ where they were, who they were with and how they felt. The moment the first astronauts land on Mars will be our moment to remember.

							<p>Why Mars, and not another planet?</p>
						</div>
						<div class="li_ans">
							The only other two celestial bodies in orbits near the Earth are our Moon and Venus. There are far fewer vital resources on the Moon, and a Moon day takes a month. It also does not have an atmosphere to form a barrier against radiation. Venus is a veritable purgatory. The average temperature is over 400 degrees, the barometric pressure is that of 900 meters underwater on Earth, and the cherry on top comes in the form of occasional bouts of acid rain. It also has nights that last for 120 days. Humans cannot live on Mars without the help of technology, but compared to Venus it's paradise!
